# How to dance with it

To start your Phoenix app:

  * Install elixir and phoenix, more details on [`https://elixir-lang.org/install.html#mac-os-x `](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html#mac-os-x ) and [`https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html`](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html)
  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Prepare db by doing `mix ecto.create` and `mix ecto.migrate`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
